# SWChen
SWChen---A program for RNA interaction analysis
# Abstract: 
The Smith-Waterman algorithm is a local sequence alignment algorithm to identify similar regions between two nucleotide or protein sequences. We acquire the interactional region between miRNA and lncRNA by Smith-Waterman algorithm and the principle of complementary base pairing. By this method, the binding probability of RNAs can be predicted to screen interesting lncRNAs, miRNAs or circRNAs.
